# EwanCotter_Project_1

The included C# Code was created for the Unity game engine as part of a final year group project for Psychology and comptuing. 

The goal of the project was to creatively redesign an existing brain training program as to make it more engaging for the users. 
The above code is part of the final prototype(out of three), where each prototype was reviewed and reported on with test users. 
The old program was found to be too repetitive, not visually stimulating and generally boring to interact with, 

While the final prototype reported a sifgnificant improvement in these areas.
